Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.









#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_set<int> s(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int longest = 0;

        for (int num : s) {
            if (s.find(num - 1) == s.end()) { 
                int current = num;
                int count = 1;
                while (s.find(current + 1) != s.end()) {
                    current++;
                    count++;
                }
                longest = max(longest, count);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
