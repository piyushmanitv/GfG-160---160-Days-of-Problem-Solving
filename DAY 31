Peak element

Given an array arr[] where no two adjacent elements are same, find the index of a peak element. An element is considered 
to be a peak if it is greater than its adjacent elements (if they exist). If there are multiple peak elements, return 
index of any one of them. The output will be "true" if the index returned by your function is correct; otherwise, it will be "false".

Note: Consider the element before the first element and the element after the last element to be negative infinity.

  public:
    int peakElement(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Your code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while(left < right){
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            
            if(arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]){
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
