You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the position of a stall.
You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. Your task is to 
assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.









class Solution {
  public:
    bool canPlace(vector<int> &stalls, int dist, int k){
        int count = 1, last = stalls[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < stalls.size(); i++){
            if(stalls[i] - last >= dist){
                count++;
                last = stalls[i];
            }
        }
        return count >= k;
    }
    int aggressiveCows(vector<int> &stalls, int k) {

        // Write your code here
        sort(stalls.begin(), stalls.end());
        int low = 1, high = stalls.back() - stalls.front(), ans = 0;
        
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
            if(canPlace(stalls, mid, k)){
                ans = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
