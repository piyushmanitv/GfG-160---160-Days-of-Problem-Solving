K Closest Points to Origin
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 62.4%Submissions: 22K+Points: 4
Given an array of points where each point is represented as points[i] = [xi, yi] on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance, defined as: 

sqrt( (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 )

Note: You can return the k closest points in any order, driver code will sort them before printing.

    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Your code here
        priority_queue<pair<int, vector<int>>> pq;
        
        for(auto& p : points){
            int dist = p[0]*p[0] + p[1]*p[1];
            pq.push({dist, p});
            if(pq.size() > k) pq.pop();
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        while(!pq.empty()){
            res.push_back(pq.top().second);
            pq.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
