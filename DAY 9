Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 15.06%Submissions: 683K+Points: 4Average Time: 25m



Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.












class Solution {
  public:
    int getMinDiff(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int res = arr.back() - arr[0];
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            if(arr[i] - k < 0) continue;
            int minH = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k);
            int maxH = max(arr[i - 1] + k, arr.back() - k);
            res = min(res, maxH - minH);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
