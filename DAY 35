Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  









class Solution {
  public:
    int kthMissing(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // Your code goes here
        int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high){
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
            int missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1);
            if(missing < k) low = mid + 1;
            else high = mid - 1;
        }
        return low + k;
    }
};
