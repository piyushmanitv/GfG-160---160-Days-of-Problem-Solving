Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.
Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.
A BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees














class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to check whether a Binary Tree is BST or not.
    bool isBST(Node* root, long minVal = LONG_MIN, long maxVal = LONG_MAX) {
        // Your code here
        if(!root) return true;
        if(root->data <= minVal || root->data >= maxVal) return false;
        return isBST(root->left, minVal, root->data) && isBST(root->right, root->data, maxVal);
    }
};
