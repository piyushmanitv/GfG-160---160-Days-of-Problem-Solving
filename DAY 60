Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.










class Solution {

  public:
    int maxWater(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while(left <  right){
            int water = min(arr[left], arr[right])*(right - left);
            res = max(res, water);
            
            if(arr[left] < arr[right])
                left += 1;
            else
                right -= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
