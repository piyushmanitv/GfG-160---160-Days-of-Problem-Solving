Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.








class Solution {
  public:
    void sort012(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
        
        while (mid <= high){
            if (arr[mid] == 0)
                swap(arr[low++], arr[mid++]);
            else if(arr[mid] == 1)
                mid++;
            else 
                swap(arr[mid], arr[high--]);
        }
    }
};
