Min Cost Climbing Stairs
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 50.04%Submissions: 34K+Points: 4
Given an array of integers cost[] where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, you can either climb one or two steps. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Assume 0-based Indexing. You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.











class Solution {
  public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        // Write your code here
        int n = cost.size();
        int dp[n+2] = {0};
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            dp[i] = cost[i]+min(dp[i+1],dp[i+2]);
        }
        return min(dp[0],dp[1]);
    }
};
