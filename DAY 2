You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right 
end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning 
you should not use extra space for another array.








class Solution {
  public:
    void pushZerosToEnd(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int j = 0;
        for( int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++ ){
            if(arr[i] != 0)
                swap(arr[i], arr[j++]);
        }
    }
};
