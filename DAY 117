Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 21.9%Submissions: 235K+Points: 4
There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1
stair or 2 stairs at a time. Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).











class Solution {
  public:
    int countWays(int n) {
        // your code here
        static const double sqrt5 = sqrt(5.0);
        static const double phi   = (1.0 + sqrt5) / 2.0;
    
        double approx = pow(phi, n + 1) / sqrt5;
    
        return static_cast<int>(approx + 0.5);
        
    }
};
