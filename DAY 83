Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     













/*
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        // code here
        if(node == nullptr) return;
        swap(node->left, node->right);
        mirror(node->left);
        mirror(node->right);
    }
};
