Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 56.57%Submissions: 109K+Points: 4
Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward..
