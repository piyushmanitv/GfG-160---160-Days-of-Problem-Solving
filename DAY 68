Given the head a linked list, the task is to reverse every k node in the linked list. 
If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then the left-out nodes in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed.









/*
  Node is defined as
    struct node
    {
        int data;
        struct Node* next;

        Node(int x){
            data = x;
            next = NULL;
        }

    }*head;

class Solution {
  public:
    struct Node* reverseKGroup(struct Node* head, int k){
        if(!head || k <= 1) return head;
        
        
        Node *curr = head;
        Node *prev = nullptr, *next = nullptr;
        int count = 0;
        
        while(curr && count < k) {
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
            count++;
        }
    
        
        if(next){
            head->next = reverseKGroup(next, k);
        }
        return prev;
