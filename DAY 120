Coin Change (Count Ways)
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 43.1%Submissions: 298K+Points: 4
Given an integer array coins[ ] representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ]. 
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. Therefore, you can use any coin as many times as you want.
Answers are guaranteed to fit into a 32-bit integer. 








class Solution {
  public:
    int count(vector<int>& coins, int sum) {
        // code here.
         int n=coins.size();
        vector<int> dp(sum+1, 0);
        dp[0]=1;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int x=coins[i];
            
            for(int j=x;j<=sum;j++){
                dp[j]+=dp[j-x];
            }
        }
        return dp[sum];
    }
};
