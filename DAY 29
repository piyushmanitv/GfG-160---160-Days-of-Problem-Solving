class Solution {
  public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& arr) {
        // complete the function here
        int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
        while(low < high){
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            if(arr[mid] > arr[high])
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid;
        }
        return arr[low];
    }
